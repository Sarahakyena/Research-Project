# Research-Project

The purpose of this project is to build models based on neural network architectures in  order to predict US civilian unemployment
across four forecast horizons. The three architectures we considered are; LSTM, Encoder Decoder and Multi-layer Perceptron.
The Encoder Decoder was built using an two stacked LSTM cell, one as an Encoder and the other as a Decoder.
